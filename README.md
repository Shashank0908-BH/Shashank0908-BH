## 🧬 About Me

**B.Tech Biotechnology (Drug Discovery) student at Bennett University** (CGPA: 9.1/10.0, Expected May 2027).  
Driven by a passion for AI in healthcare, computational biology, and NLP, I architect intelligent platforms and scalable systems for life sciences and government.

## 🏆 Experience

**Summer Research Intern – CSIR-IITR**  
*June 2025 – August 2025, Lucknow, India*  
- Architected a multi-modal deep learning platform (GNNs + Transformers) for neurotoxicity prediction, achieving 89.4% accuracy on 3K+ compounds.
- Deployed a Flask REST API for real-time molecular featurization and Applicability Domain analysis, improving research cycles by 60%.
- Optimized molecular embedding pipelines, reducing preprocessing time from 20s to under 5s per compound.

**Founder & Chief Architect – HealthGPT (AI SaaS Platform)**  
*June 2022 – July 2024, Remote*  
- Built and scaled a Generative AI health assistant (7B parameter LLM) for biomedical literature, serving 2,000+ active users.
- Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Pinecone, enabling sub-second retrieval latency for 1M+ medical documents.
- Designed and maintained AWS microservices (Lambda, API Gateway, EC2), achieving 99.9% uptime.

> **Note:** Most of my work at HealthGPT, CSIR-IITR, and Enterprise Case Management for NIC was performed confidentially for government projects. As a result, the repositories and further details of these works are not publicly accessible. If you would like to know more about my experience, feel free to connect!
